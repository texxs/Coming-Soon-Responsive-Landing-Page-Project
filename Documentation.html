							 <p>I've worked real hard to make sure this template is as simple as possible, so that if a person is not a Web Designer and still wants to use this, they can.  As with any HTML template, The user needs to be willing to learn at least a very small amount of web design tools to use it.  It has to be uploaded and you'll probably want to change the text from something like "some content here" to something more meaningful to your website. If you know even a little HTML/CSS then you should breeze through this with no problems whatsoever.  If you have ever edited and uploaded an HTML file to the internet you almost certianly have everything you need.   </p>

              <p>But even if you <em>are</em> a complete noob, I can help you get this done too.  Lets start with the things you'll need:</p>
								<ul>

                  <li>A domain name - I recomend you get it from <a href="http://godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> and let them teach you how (it's wicked easy) to point it to the next item on this list.</li>

                  <li>A Webhosting account - I recomend <a href="http://texxsmith.com" target="_blank">me</a> or <a href="http://hostdime.com" target="_blank">Hostdime</a>.  They in turn can tell you the specific info you'll need to enter into the next item on the list.</li>

                  <li>FTP software - I recomend <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>, it's free and every knows how to explain how to use it.</li>

                  <li>A Plain Text Editor.  Your computer comes with one already.  On Windows it's called Notepad.  Just be sure to use one that does NOT do formatting like making text bold (rich text), as it adds extra mark up to your text that will screw up a web page.</li>

Sometimes it's good to use them just because they look awesome or you want the user to focus less on the background and more on the foreground.  Whatever the case, I've made it easy.  Just add:<br>

													<code>

															&lt;link href='css/overlay.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;

													</code>

													<br>underneath the two existing refrences to style sheets.  They are usually on lines 9 and 10 and they look like this:

Instead of pasting the code directly into your HTML document, paste it into a plain text document instead, then copy that and paste that into your HTML document.  Look through that code for the "name" attribute followed by a long numerical value.  It should look similar to this:<br>

													<code>name="b_e0afxxwer456fe7e103xx90a45dd358_cbxxcb3aa6f"</code>

													<br>Replace the one in the HTML document with yours.  Unless, of course, you wish to replace the whole form with a default looking one from mailchimp.

													<li>Add the CountDown.css file to your HTML document by pasting this line into the head section of your HTML document:<br>
															<code>&lt;link href='css/countDown.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;</code>.  Just to be safe make sure it's the last css file referenced in the head section.</li>

													<li>Open init.js with a text editor, change the value for	&quot;date&quot; on line 6 to reflect the date you want.</li>

Simply delete them and everyting in between them.  Better still you could "comment them out"  by adding an opening comment tag ( <code>&lt;!--</code> ) before the opening video tag and a closing comment tag ( <code>--&gt;</code> ) after the closing video tag.  This way, if you change your mind and want to use video after all, you can simply delete the comment tags.</p>

I've written CSS files that will determine what size a device is and serve the rightr size image.  After you select an image you'd like to use, simply add the appropriate css file below the other css files in the head f your HTML file. Look at the source code of any of the background image only examples like <a href="Image_FoggyField.html"> Foggy Florida Field</a> for a specific example of where and how to add the css file.</p>

                              <p>When a background image (or video) have both light and dark colors in it, it can be hard to read no matter what color your text is.  To help help make it more readable, you can put a semi-transparent colored background below the content but above the background.  You can do this by finding the content div (it uses the class "container" and is right above the first <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. Inside of that content div paste in: <code>&lt;div class="darkBack"&gt;</code>. If you are using the "dark" class to make your text dark then you should probably use a lighter background by using  <code>class="lightBack"</code> instead. Where you add that tag will be where the colored background section begins and where you add the next tag, <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> will determine where it ends.  I recomend ending the colored background section after the last paragraph but before the button , if you use a button that is. . .</p>

							  <p>If you have advanced HTML and CSS knowledge, you may have noticed that there is no framework like Bootstrap used in the templates.  Nor did I build a full grid system of my own for this project.  This is so that these templates can be easily integrated into any front end or framework you are using.  The K.I.S.S. approach often allows for maximum flexibility.  It's no different in this case.</p>
                                <p><strong>Note: </strong>If you have more than one full line of text in the paragraph(s), I recomend wrapping the text within the "small" tag by adding <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> after the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> taga and also adding <code>&lt;/small&gt;</code> before the closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag.</p>

												<p><strong>I noticed that the video background is turned of by default for smaller mobile devices like phones.  How can I change that?</strong></p>
											<p>By removing some lines from the mobile sections of <em>core.css</em>.  Near the bottom of the file there are two sections dedicated to devices smaller with screen than 799 pixels wide (which does depend on whether the user is holding it in landscape or portrait view).Comment out (add the css comment tag "<code>*/</code>" before the line and the closing comment tag "<code>/*</code>" after the line), or remove this rule from one or both sections: </p>

												<p>Have you made a video you want to use?  Great!  Since you are making your own videos I can only guess that you have at least a little skill in video editing and are at least familiar with the concepts of video compression.  But if I’m wrong, you’ll need know at least a little about <a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/video-compression-basics" target="_blank">the basics of video compression</a>.</p>
											<p>
												After you’ve edited and output your final video file you have two choices about how to proceed.  Host the video on your own web hosting account or YouTube.    I recommend self hosting but if you are expecting a lot of traffic then it could get expensive to host the video from your own web host.  For most coming soon pages, this isn’t a concern.
											</p>
											<p>To self host a video you’ll need to output more than one copy of it.  To be sure that it works on all operating systems/browsers and devices it needs to be in a few different file formats:  .webm, .ogg,  and .mp4 .  See my <a href="http://texxsmith.net/support/articles/video-file-formats.php" target="_blank" title="Opens in a a new tab">FAQ</a> on which video file format is best if you are wondering what the differences are.</p>
											<p>Take those files, upload them to the vids folder on your web host via FTP and then change the file name in the src attributes of the video tag in your html file.  And of course, save it as index.html and upload it to the root directory of your web hosting account.</p>

												<p><strong>Yes!</strong>  You can use a YouTube video as a background with the Coming Soon Responsive Landing Page Project&#153;.  First start with the right template:  <a href="Feature_YouTube.html">Feature_YouTube.html</a>.  Like the PHP form, the code behind is kinda complicated but the part you need to change is easy to find and do.</p>
                                                <p>Next find a youtube video that you want to use and then copy it's "video ID" out of the url.  You can see this in the address bar of your browser or by clicking the "share" tab on the ytoutube page.  Once yhou have the VideoID number you just replace the one on line 28 with your, without removing the single quote marks around it, save your changes.  Presto! it's using your new video.
